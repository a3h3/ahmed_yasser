Hi! I’m ahmed yasser, and I’m a developer who has passion 
for building clean web applications with intuitive 
functionalities. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into
 reality using creative solutions. I’m always curious about
 learning new skills, tools, and concepts. In addition to working
 on various solo full stack projects, I have worked with creative teams,
 which involves daily stand-ups and communications, source control,
 and project management.
